### IDEAS: 

###### Unfinished and not fully fleshed out songs/beats/etc. 

- Project files or bounces/midi files of riffs/melodies/grooves that have potential to materialize. 

- Maybe you dicked around for and hour and kinda think it's trash but not a dumpster fire and wanna come back to it later type thing.
