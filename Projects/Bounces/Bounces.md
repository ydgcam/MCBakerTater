###### Guidelines

- File Naming Convention: Song Title and export date. 
    Ex: "Floating_08_10_23"

- Criteria: 
    Mixes and bounced audio files of songs you are woking on or are completed

- Directory Structure: 
    Masters: Finished songs
    Mixes: Working versions of projects

    Each file will fall into one of these two directories. Each one of these directories will have sub directories for projects
        Ex: /Bounces/Mixes/Floating/Floating_08_10_23.wav
